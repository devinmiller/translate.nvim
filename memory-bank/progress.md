# Progress

## What Works
- **Core Translation Functionality**: The plugin can translate words using the Wiktionary data
- **Visual Selection**: Works with both current word under cursor and visual selections
- **Floating Window Display**: Translations are shown in a configurable floating window
- **Rich Formatting**: Entries are formatted with Markdown for better readability
- **Window Navigation**: Users can scroll through translation content with keyboard shortcuts
- **Configuration System**: Users can customize various aspects of the plugin
- **Toggle Behavior**: The window closes when the same word is selected twice, but updates when a different word is selected
- **State Management**: Plugin state is properly maintained using the boilerplate pattern with getter/setter methods and explicit save() function

## Implementation Details
- **Dictionary Search**: Uses ripgrep for efficient searching in large dictionary files
- **JSON Processing**: Uses JQ to process and transform the dictionary entries
- **Entry Formatting**: Formats entries with headers, subheaders, forms, and definitions
- **Window Management**: Creates and manages floating windows with proper cleanup

## What's Left to Build
- **Multiple Language Support**: Currently only supports one language at a time
- **Dictionary File Management**: Automatic downloading and management of dictionary files
- **Improved Search**: Fuzzy matching, spell correction, and more robust search capabilities
- **Alternative Translation Sources**: Integration with online translation APIs as fallback
- **User Documentation**: Comprehensive documentation for end users

## Known Issues
- Requires external tools (ripgrep, jq) to be installed on the user's system
- Dictionary files need to be downloaded separately
- Limited to the content available in the Wiktionary data
- No fuzzy matching or spell correction for search terms

## Current Status
The plugin is functional for its core purpose of providing in-editor translations using Wiktionary data. It offers a good user experience with a non-disruptive floating window and rich formatting of translation entries.

## Next Development Priorities
1. **Improve Documentation**: Create comprehensive user documentation
2. **Dictionary File Management**: Simplify the process of obtaining and managing dictionary files
3. **Multiple Language Support**: Allow users to work with multiple languages simultaneously
4. **Search Improvements**: Enhance search capabilities for better matching and results
