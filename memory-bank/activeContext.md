# Active Context

## Current Focus
The current focus is on improving state management in the translate.nvim plugin by following the Neovim plugin boilerplate pattern. This includes implementing a proper state module with getter/setter methods and a save() function, while ensuring the toggle behavior for the floating window works correctly.

## Recent Changes
- Updated the state.lua file to follow the boilerplate pattern with local state and explicit save() function
- Added getter/setter methods for state properties (float, selection, main_buf_id)
- Removed redundant checks for the global Translate module in init.lua
- Updated state access in init.lua to use the new getter/setter methods
- Simplified the setup function in init.lua
- Preserved special Neovim-specific characters in the scroll functions

## Active Decisions
- **Documentation Structure**: Organized memory bank with clear separation of concerns (product, system, technical)
- **Architecture Documentation**: Mapped out the component relationships and data flow
- **Feature Documentation**: Documented existing features and potential improvements

## Current Considerations
- **Code Quality**: The codebase appears well-structured with clear separation of concerns
- **External Dependencies**: The plugin relies on external tools (ripgrep, jq) which users need to install
- **User Experience**: The plugin provides a non-disruptive translation experience with a floating window
- **Configuration**: The plugin offers flexible configuration options for customization

## Open Questions
- How are dictionary files distributed/installed?
- Are there any specific performance optimizations needed for large dictionary files?
- What are the priorities for future development (multiple languages, improved search, etc.)?
- Are there any specific user feedback or issues that need to be addressed?

## Next Steps
- Test the new toggle behavior to ensure it works as expected
- Consider additional user experience improvements:
  - Add a configuration option to enable/disable the toggle behavior
  - Improve visual feedback when toggling the window
- Update user documentation to reflect the new behavior
- Consider other window management improvements, such as:
  - Remembering window position between invocations
  - Adding keyboard shortcuts for resizing the window
